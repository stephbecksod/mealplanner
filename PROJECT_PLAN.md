# Meal Planner App - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Build a dinner planning app (web + mobile) that generates customized weekly dinner plans with smart grocery lists, recipe storage, and beverage pairings. Available as a web app (nomnomplan.com) and native mobile apps for iOS and Android. All platforms share the same Supabase backend for seamless cross-device sync.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend (Web)**: React with React Router for navigation
- **Frontend (Mobile)**: React Native with Expo (iOS & Android)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API routes (local dev)
- **Backend (Production)**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for meal/beverage generation
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (email/password)
- **Styling (Web)**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Styling (Mobile)**: React Native StyleSheet

## Core Features

### 1. Dinner Plan Generation
- Allow users to select 1-5 dinners per week
- Incorporate dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free, low-carb, etc.)
- Generate dinner suggestions using user preferences
- Default serving size: 4 people (adjustable per dinner)
- Enable cuisine preference selection for the week
- Allow to regenerate a single meal once initial set is generated if the user doesn't like the meal for that week
- Allow to add a meal or delete a meal from the week - as meals are added or deleted this impacts the shopping list accordingly
- Goal should be that the meals are diverse but use a lot of overlapping ingredients throughout the week to simplify grocery shopping
- Ability to add a dinner from the favorite recipes saved
- Meals are persistent in the app until all regenerated. There is a confirmation step prior to regenerating all meals or a single meal that confirms that the meals should be regenerated

### 2. Smart Grocery List
- Auto-generate from selected dinners with quantities adjusted for serving sizes
- Interactive checklist format with click-to-check functionality
- Allow manual addition of extra items
- Group items by category (produce, dairy, proteins, pantry, etc.)
- Toggle to include beverage ingredients (cocktail ingredients + wine)

### 3. Recipe Details
- Display full ingredients list with quantities
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Prep time and cook time estimates

### 4. Save & Memory System
- Save individual favorite recipes, side dishes, and cocktails
- Search and browse saved recipes and dinner plans
- There is a favorites tab or page in the application that users can navigate to in order to find saved meals
- The saved meals are persistent over time, you can navigate away from saved meals and go back to saved meals and they can still be there
- Toggle favorite on/off directly from meal cards

### 5. Beverage Pairing Feature
- For each dinner, offer to generate cocktail recipe and/or wine pairing separately
- Show flavor profile explanation for why they complement the dinner
- Toggle to include beverage ingredients in grocery list
- Wine section in grocery list with checkboxes
- The cocktail recipes can also be saved
- The meal recipe and cocktail recipe show up together on a "meal"

### 6. Side Dish Feature
- Generate complementary side dishes for each main dish
- AI analyzes main dish to suggest appropriate side type (vegetable, starch, salad)
- Side dishes can be added/removed individually per meal
- Side dish recipes can be saved to favorites

**Mobile App Structure**:
```

6. Build and submit to app stores

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Multi-user with Supabase** - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- **Supabase Auth** for user authentication (email/password)
- **API designed RESTfully** to support cloud deployment
- **Component architecture** allows easy addition of features
- **React Context** for state management (can upgrade to Redux if needed)
- **Data migration** from localStorage to Supabase handled via migration modal
- **Optimistic updates** for favorites (immediate UI feedback, rollback on error)
- **Server-first updates** for meal plans (wait for confirmation on AI-generated data)
